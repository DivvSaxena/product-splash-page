# Skydiving Splash Page

Welcome to the Skydiving Splash Page project! In this project, we've created a Product Splash Page using HTML and CSS with a focus on responsiveness through media queries. This page is dedicated to introducing and exciting users about the thrilling adventure sport of skydiving.

## Overview

Skydiving is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves jumping out of an aircraft from high altitudes and free-falling before deploying a parachute to land safely. It's a thrilling experience that combines the adrenaline rush of falling through the sky with the serenity of floating gently back to Earth. This splash page serves as a gateway to all the excitement that skydiving has to offer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** We've implemented responsive design techniques using media queries to ensure that the page looks great and functions well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

- **Engaging Content:** The page includes compelling content that highlights the key aspects of skydiving, its thrill, and the experience of free-falling and parachuting.
